## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS, Node.

My first time creating an App with Node and EJS. Users are able to create new life hacks, vote on current ones, and delete hacks!

## Optimizations

I would create more features, such as adding a short description to life hacks as well as the ability for users to comment under other life hacks.

I would also freshen up the CSS more for a better user experience.


## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to connect my front end to the back end using my own API's. I'm now able to listen for requests on my front end, send data to the database, then update the front end.


## Examples

Take a look at these other examples that I have in my portfolio:
